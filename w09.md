# Top 10 List of Week 09

#### DISCLAIMER: NOT IN ORDER
1. [Linux 101: Check Disk Space Commands](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-check-disk-space-command/)<br>
Website is created very neatly. Ordered also very neatly.
It's an easy read to the eye while still being informative.
If you need to freshen up on how to check disk space, highly suggested you bookmark this.

2. [What Is BIOS](https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/BIOS-basic-input-output-system)<br>
Short enough read, cut to the point.
Great usage of font and very informative.
Give it a read if you haven't already know what a BIOS is.

3. [Understanding and How To Use Systemd](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/understanding-and-using-systemd/)<br>
Longer read means it is more informative.
It goes deep into the detail on what systemd is and the commands you can use.
Give it a read to know how to use systemd.

4. [What Is LILO?](https://www.interserver.net/tips/kb/what-is-lilo/)<br>
LILO is short for Linux Loader.
If you don't know what a loader is, check it below.
This website talks about LILO specifically, so it is a shorter read, but is still informative enough.

5. [Loader in OS](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/8104/loader)
Very short read but doesn't left you feel needing to know more.
It cut to the chase and gives a good experience for you who just want to know what a loader is in a quick three to five minutes.

6. [Harddrive Statistics: Storage Failure Rates](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/backblaze-hard-drive-stats-q2-2020/)
Ever wonder how each hard drive compare to other hard drive in term of failure rates?
Website gives the chart and also accompany the charts with explanation, so it is newbie friendly to read.
Data are also relevant, it's done in 2020, so it is still worth a read.

7. [RAID: Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)
Good website if you actually want to study.
Longer read, more information too digest, need time to study how it work.
Website gives visualization and illustration which makes learning much easier on what is RAID.

8. [Systemctl: The "New" Systemd](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units)
A much, much, much, longer read. Perhaps one of the longest I have put.
Very good though, informative tutorials. If you like to follow along, you can always just copy paste what the website tolds you to.
Learning and seeing the process unfolds yourself while being guided helps in understanding what Systemctl is.

9. [UEFI Vs Legacy Bios](https://phoenixts.com/blog/uefi-vs-legacy-bios/)
For a website that talk about two things at once, it compared both efficiently.
It is still a medium read, but most other website explains the same core while needing much more text.
Give it a read if you want to know more about UEFI Vs Legacy Bios.

10. [Storage Array, What Is It?](https://www.mycloudwiki.com/san/what-is-storage-array/)
You want to know what storage array is?
Website at first seems like a long read, but it isn't. Many parts are made out of points which makes the length of the website deceiving.
It is actually just a medium size read while being efficient in what it wants to say.
Recommended read.
