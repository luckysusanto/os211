# Top 10 List of Week 03

#### DISCLAIMER: NOT IN ORDER

1. [Files & Files System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)<br>
We all know a file is a sequence of many 0's and 1's, but what you probably don't know is how those are stored. 
The video talks about basic and most commonly used files like .txt, .wav, and .bmp, and explained it very consicely.
It also talks about Files system, i.e, how our operating system keep track of what file is where in an easily learned manner.

2. [Image File Formats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww12lImOJ38)<br>
There are many different type of image files, but have you ever wondered why there are so many?
While this video sadly doesn't cover the specifics and it's inner working details (no talk about what each format saves for its metadata), it is still very clear.

3. [Buffer Overflow Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S0aBV-Waeo)<br>
So... if Files System is used to keep track of what file is where, why are there so many type of them?
Even though its job is only to know where each file is, this job is what keeps files integrity together. 
Like any system, this is obviously exploitable, especially when you know how the file system work. This video explain how linux file system can be attacked.

4. [File System Concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzUyMy7Ihk0)<br>
Do you know what a file system is? No?
Well, look no further, in 3 minutes, you get to understand what a file system is, and more importantly, what is the concept behind it, and what does it do.

5. [Types of printf](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/man3/printf.3.html)<br>
You might see the demo for week 03 of OS. Maybe you found yourself stuck just like I did, wondering "so what?"
So, when stuck, we GSGS! <br>
This is a very wonderful documentation regarding printf and it's variation and what differentiate them!
It's very thorough as well!

6. [Linux File System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIXzJ3Rz9po)<br>
We have been using our virtual box to simulate linux for a while now.
Perhaps it is also time we learn how it stores files!
While this video is pretty long, it is thorough and tells you what each folder does what!

7. [Many Types of File System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws)<br>
Along the history of computer, there's always a start, and there will always be innovation.
This video talks about what file system used to exist and what it current iteration is capable of.
It also groups the file systems nicely to be understood! Definitely a must watch.

8. [Log-Structured File System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTCkW_6zz2k)<br>
What would happen if a file system suddenly crash? Many data would be lost, that would be catastrophic.
Not only is it time consuming to reinstall the os if the damage was bad, many data will also get corrupted!
Journaling and Log-Structured File System tolerates this by makings Logs so when a crash happen, just go to the latest!
Want more info? See the video!

9. [What Are Drive Partitions?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeUM4kR67XQ)<br>
Perhaps you already know the answer to what partitions are. But, have you asked yourself, Why do we still need to know about partitions?
Why not just dump all your data in that 8TB storage? Well, the answers can be found, on the video!

10. [FUSE: File Systems in User Space](https://fsgeek.ca/2019/06/18/fuse-file-systems-in-user-space/)<br>
So, we know what file systems are, and we know what is the user space.
So, what is FUSE? Well... Explained in this documentation!
