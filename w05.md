# Top 10 List of Week 05

#### DISCLAIMER: NOT IN ORDER

1. [What is Memory Hierarchy? Explain with Diagram!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/memory-hierarchy-design-and-its-characteristics/)<br>
We are now learning about Memory Hierarchy and many stuff, so, let's freshen up from Computer Architecture!
Need a quick reminder? This site got it covered!

2. [RAM vs Storage](https://www.backblaze.com/blog/whats-diff-ram-vs-storage/)<br>
Considering we are using our laptop every single day, do you know what the difference is between RAM and Storage?
If you recall Computer Architecture, then, great! Oh, you don't?
Check the website for a quick but very insightful tour!

3. [Linux: Shared Memory vs Resident Memory vs Virtual Memory](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/difference-between-resident-memory-shared-memory-and-virtual-memory-in-system-monitor-598734/)<br>
Without you actually knowing it, there's a lot of different type of memory! 
Each of them have their own job, and have their own uses, for example, Shared Memory to do pararel data accessing!
Want to learn more? Check this old but gold forum posts!

4. [Allocating Kernel Memory](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocating-kernel-memory-buddy-system-slab-system/)<br>
Have you ever heard of the buddy allocation system? No?
Well... don't you want to know? It's called buddy allocation!
Check it now! The website not only talk about this buddy allocation system, but also how it works for the kernel memory!

5. [FIFO Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Before we delve even deeper into OS, you need to know how the memory works!
I've posted a lot of links regarding memory ofc, but, it is also good to know one algorithm to understand how it really works!
The algorithm is called FIFO (First In First Out, remember Queue?), and the explanation can be see, there!

6. [Why Multi-Core?](https://superuser.com/questions/152011/why-multi-core-processors)<br>
Moore's law state that every 18 months, the number of processor in a computer will double in amount while shrinking in size!
But, we are hitting a physical wall, the law of the universe, heat.
Everything creates heat, and when you are a transistor working very hard, you are creating very huge amount of heat!
This is why single-core has fallen out of fashion, so, the answer? MULTI-CORE! Check the link!

7. [Commands: Monitoring in Linux](https://linoxide.com/linux-top-command-examples-screenshots/)<br>
"Hey, why doesn't linux have a Task Manager?", Well, jokes on you, of course it does!
You just need to learn how to open it through your terminal!
You want to know? You really want to know? Check the list of useful commands in that link!

8. [Memory Safety](https://arunrajeevan.medium.com/what-is-memory-safety-in-programming-1e5300fe6c48)<br>
Because of limitations (but mostly oversights), there are a lot of exploitable "features" in everything.
The worst one of all is the exploitation of a system's memory!
This can happen in many way, I've even talk about this some week ago about how to manipulate and run sudo without permission!
Of course, it is easier said than done, but when there's bad intention, there's a way.
So, do you want to protect yourself? Learn how to here!

9. [What is Thrashing?](https://www.thecrazyprogrammer.com/2019/02/thrashing-in-operating-system-os.html)<br>
You have DEFINITELY experienced using a laptop and then, it just suddenly stop!
And then it moves a bit, but then it's still SO SLOW!
What is this aggravating thing?
Well, it is called Thrashing, remember the cost of putting the correct blocks in the RAM in Computer Architecture?
When your computer keeps on searching for the correct blocks, it is called Thrashing, and it slows your computer to a snail pace!

10. [Paging File in 5 minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VDP5TCAK2c)<br>
You don't have a lot of time?
But you want to learn in a short amount of time?
Well, that isn't idea isn't it?
But, I have a RARE solution! Watch the video that only take 5 minutes of your time to learn about Paging File!
