# Top 10 List of Week 05

#### DISCLAIMER: NOT IN ORDER

1. [Why Use Binary?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thrx3SBEpL8)<br>
Everything in our computer is translated into binary which is then processed into data than it can understand.
But then, why binary? Why not decimal?
One of the answer is because energy consumptions! Want more explanation? check the video!

2. [History of Byte](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixJCo0cyAuA)<br>
Sometimes it is easier to learn about something when you know its history.
Byte was made because there was a need for precisions and efficiency, a revolutionary break through made by IBM.

3. [Keyboard: Data Interupts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewE8b7zzej0)<br>
We have learned that data, like characters, are sent as ASCII code to the computer.
The question is, how does this mechanism work? Like always, science give an answer.
Using carbon and voltage to read what button is being pressed and then sending an interrupt signals allow the computer to read the data.
Want to know more? Check the video.

4. [Fetch-Execute Cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5JC9Ve1sfI)<br>
Remember "Introduction to Computer Organization" course?
No? Well, here's a quick catch up on how our computer process instruction to recap!
Very short but very clear, and its enough to remind you how computer works.

5. [Numbers, Letters, Symbols, Japanese?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GSjbWt0c9M)<br>
How do computers represent numbers? Well, computer DO save data in binary, so that's easy.
But what about Letters and Symbols? Well, ASCII is one of them.
But, but, what about a language that has OVER 1000 symbols? Answer is, UNICODE.
Want to learn more about those? Check video.

6. [Hardware Memory Protection](http://operatingsystempoly.blogspot.com/p/hardware-protection.html)<br>
Why do we need to protect the hardware's memory? Because when an interrupt happens, we need to make sure after the interrupt, the software will continue the job it left.
So, the question is, what part of the computer needs to be given this memory protection and how do we protect the memory?
Check the website!

7. [The Power of Pointers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5NszbIerYc)<br>
When you reference the first character of a string, you can traverse through the string.
But this is of course not its only use. Pointers allow data that belongs to a group to be placed on non-sequenced memory.
This is called Dynamic Memory Allocation. 
Want to learn more? Watch the video.

8. [Dynammic Memory Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-dynamic-memory-allocation/)<br>
Last week we have learned about a lot of how computer saves data. One of it being dynamic memory allocation.
This is very useful because a lot of the time, the next block of memory is already used, and overwriting it is an obvious mistake.
To prevent this, the concept of dynammic memory allocation is born.
You should definitely read the article, this is a very important concept to understand!

9. [Pointer in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-HBipu_1P0)<br>
We already know why Pointers is very important.
Now, how do we use them in C?
You can always check the demo, but this is also a good source to learn it!
So, go watch the video.

10. [-Endians, why?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)<br>
So, in "Introduction to Computer Architecture" We have learned that there is a concept called little-endian and big-endian.
The question you might NOT have asked is, why do we have 2 systems? Why not just make one unified systems?
And wouldn't it be inefficienct to have 2 different systems and doing convertion everytime?
Answer is in the video!
