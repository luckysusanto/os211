# Top 10 List of Week 08

#### DISCLAIMER: NOT IN ORDER
1. [6 CPU Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.guru99.com/cpu-scheduling-algorithms.html)<br>
Do you know what CPU Scheduling is? No? Well, that's okay! This site starts off by explaining what CPU Scheduling is.
After that, it talks about 6 CPU Scheduling algorithms and what differentiate each of them from the others!
The explanation is given with bullet points, which might a pros or cons to some people, but it is clearly described!

2. [CPU Scheduling Criteria](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-criteria/)<br>
Now that we know some CPU Scheduling Algorithms, we need to know when to use which.
There is no one fit all solutions, so knowing what is best to use on certain criteria is important!
Since you already know about when to use what from point (1), this websites talks more deeply about what those criteria are
in a very consice manner.

3. [Multiprocessor Scheduling Issues](https://www.ques10.com/p/46913/issues-in-multiprocessor-scheduling-1/)<br>
When you only have one core, it's very easy to schedule tasks that must be done. 
This of course doesn't work when we talk about multiprocessor core. Scheduling which tasks must be done first isn't very obvious.
This website talks about the three main issues that commonly arise regarding multiprocessor scheduling.
It is also a rather short read, but it is still important to read.

4. [Real Time Scheduling Algorithms](https://open4tech.com/rtos-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
This website talks about some of the same algorithms explained in point (1). BUT, it also contains visualization.
This is a deeper read regarding Scheduling algorithms and how they actually work instead of just mere explanation.
The website talks about it clearly and it is not a hard read by any means.

5. [Windows 10: Multilevel Feedback Queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multilevel-feedback-queue-scheduling-mlfq-cpu-scheduling/)
Did you know Windows 10 uses multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm? No? Now you know!
So, how does it works? The algorithm is rather complex, but it offers flexibility in return.
Want to know more? Read the website!

6. [Linux: Completely Fair Process Scheduling](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/fair-scheduling-linux)
Now that you know what scheduling algorithm Windows 10 use, you should also know what Linux use!
Linux uses an algorithm called Completely Fair Process or CFS for short.
How does it work? Read the website!
It is quite a longer read, but it is important to know it, so, get reading!

7. [Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling.html)
So, there is two type of scheduling in OS. The first one is preemptive and the second one is non-preemptive.
Preemptive scheduling allows interruption of lower-priority usage of the processor, while non-preemptive does not.
This is of course not everything, there's a lot of difference between the two.
This is one of the longer read as well, but it goes deep and talk about the thing you need to know quickly.

8. [Load Balancing](https://www.citrix.com/en-id/solutions/app-delivery-and-security/load-balancing/what-is-load-balancing.html)
In short terms, Load balancer are objects that checks if a system can handle a request or not.
If the system is busy, it will redirect the request to a system that is idle.
But how does Load balancer works exactly?
Read the website! It's a medium length read, but its concept are easy to grasp.

9. [Process Scheduling](https://www.guru99.com/process-scheduling.html)
"Process Scheduling is an OS task that schedules processes of different states like ready, waiting, and running".
Because of this, it allows the OS to allocate intervals and create schedules for each processes.
This website explains it deeply but also in a very easy to understand way!
Give it a read.

10. [Hard vs Soft Time System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-hard-real-time-and-soft-real-time-system/)
There's generally two known type of time systems, hard and soft.
Hard time system doesn't allow any part of its processes to be "late". The result could be catastrophic.
On the other hand, Soft time system set a soft limit on when the deadline of the process is due.
This site explains it in a very consise way and it's a very short read!
